Unfortunately, I like money💰💵🤑 and would like to live a lavish lifestyle💎.\nI have included a picture of me from the future (it is NOT photoshopped)🌅. For those who would like to contribute to my wellbeing and fulfilling my destiny I have included several ways to donate that sweet sweet money.\nYa boy, kmikiy now accepts several cryptocurrencies.\nScroll down for more info ⬇️";
