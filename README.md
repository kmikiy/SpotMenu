## üîë Spotify Setup (Required for Liking Tracks)

2. Log in and click **"Create an App"**
3. Enter a name (e.g. `SpotMenu`) and description ‚Äî any text will work.
4. In the app settings, click **"Edit Settings"**
5. Under **Redirect URIs**, add the following:

   ```
   com.github.kmikiy.spotmenu://callback
   ```

6. Click **Save**
7. Enable _Track Liking_ in SpotMenu Preferences ‚Üí _Music Player_ tab
8. Copy your **Client ID** into SpotMenu and complete the login flow

Once you're logged in, the like/unlike icons will appear and work as expected üéâ
