## 🔑 Spotify Setup (Required for Liking Tracks)

SpotMenu uses the Spotify Web API to enable liking and unliking tracks. This requires creating your own Spotify Developer App with a Client ID and setting up a redirect URI.

> 🛠️ This is **required only** if you want to use the like/unlike functionality in Spotify.

### Step-by-Step:

1. Visit [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in and click **"Create an App"**
3. Enter a name (e.g. `SpotMenu`) and description — any text will work.
4. In the app settings, click **"Edit Settings"**
5. Under **Redirect URIs**, add the following:

   ```
   com.github.kmikiy.spotmenu://callback
   ```

6. Click **Save**
7. Enable _Track Liking_ in SpotMenu Preferences → _Music Player_ tab
8. Copy your **Client ID** into SpotMenu and complete the login flow

Once you're logged in, the like/unlike icons will appear and work as expected 🎉
