SpStreamer is a combination of [TrayPlay](https://github.com/mborgerson/TrayPlay), [Statusfy](https://github.com/paulyoung/Statusfy), and [SpotMenu](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu) written entirely in swift. 

Features include
+ Dark and light theme
+ Customizing the status bar - hide/show icons
+ Displaying song and/or artist name on status bar

Easy Install
------------
+ Download the zip file [Version 1](https://github.com/FernandoX7/SpStreamer/archive/master.zip). 
+ Unarchive it. 
+ Drag and drop into Applications folder and/or just run SpStreamer.app.
+ In case of unidentified developer follow these steps!

Because the app is not signed with an official Mac Developer account, you may get the following prompt when running the app for the first time.

How to Build
------------

First, you'll need Xcode. You can download this at the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
Second, you'll need [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). 

Now, use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FernandoX7/SpStreamer.git
cd SpStreamer
pod install
```

Finally, open up the SpStreamer.xcworkspace. Set the "Scheme" to build the "SpStreamer" target for "My Mac". Then Product > Run (or the shortcut ⌘R).

Note: 
+ App is made with Swift 3.0 therefore Xcode 8 is required.
+ In some cases it might be required to select the "Spotify" scheme and build it before selecting "SpStreamer".
